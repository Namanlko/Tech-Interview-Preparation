 # 🚀 Tech Interview Preparation

**All in one preparation guide for technical interviews, covering DSA and algorithms 🚀💻**

This repository is created to help you **crack technical interviews** by building strong fundamentals in **Data Structures and Algorithms using Python**.
All problems are carefully selected from **top coding platforms** and solved with a focus on **clarity, intuition, and optimization**.

## 📌 What's Inside?

This repository contains **Python solutions** to frequently asked **technical interview questions** sourced from popular coding platforms such as:

* **LeetCode**
* **HackerRank**
* **HackerEarth**
* **InterviewBit**
* **CodeChef**
* **GeeksforGeeks**
* **Codeforces** (Selective Interview Relevant Problems)

These are **real interview level questions**, not random competitive programming problems. They reflect what is actually asked by **product based companies** in technical interviews.

✨ For **every problem**, you will find:

* ✅ **Brute Force solution**
* ⚡ **Optimized solution**
* 🧠 **Clear explanation & approach (via comments)**

The goal is not just to solve problems, but to **understand the thought process behind them**.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

I will be covering and continuously expanding the following topics:

* Arrays
* Strings
* Stack & Queue
* Linked List
* Searching & Sorting
* Binary Search
* Recursion & Backtracking
* Bit Manipulation
* Mathematics
* Number Theory
* Divide & Conquer
* Trees (Binary Tree & BST)
* Graphs (DFS, BFS, Topological Sorting)
* Sliding Window
* Two Pointers
* Greedy Algorithms
* Dynamic Programming

📈 More topics and problems will be added regularly.

## 🛠 Language Used

* **Python 🐍**
  All solutions are written in Python with readable code and proper comments.

## 🤝 How to Contribute?

Contributions are **highly encouraged** 🙌

1. Fork the repository
2. Make your changes (add / delete / modify solutions)
3. Create a Pull Request

## ✅ When to Contribute?

You can contribute if:

* A problem has **no solution** in the main branch
* Your solution is **asymptotically faster**
* Your solution has **same time complexity but cleaner / shorter code**
* You have a **different approach** (even if slower, add it as a commented solution)

Feel free to **add new questions** as well 🚀

## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi! I’m **Naman**, and I created this repository to stay consistent with **DSA preparation** and help others who are preparing for **technical interviews**.

Cracking product-based company interviews requires more than just development skills. **Strong DSA and problem-solving ability** is the key, and this repo is my step towards mastering it.

This repository is a **work in progress**, and it will keep evolving with time.
Constructive feedback, suggestions, and code reviews are always welcome.

Happy Coding & All the Best for your Interviews! 💪🔥
**Let’s grow and crack interviews together 🚀**
